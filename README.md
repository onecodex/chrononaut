A history mixin with audit logging, record locking, and time travel (!) for PostgreSQL and Flask-SQLAlchemy. Requires Flask-SQLAlchemy >= 2.2. See [the documentation](https://chrononaut.readthedocs.io/) for more details. Development and all PRs should pass tests and linting on Github Actions, including use of [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) for automated linting with `flake8` and `black`.

> _Note: Future plans include extending supporting for SQLAlchemy more generally and across multiple databases._
